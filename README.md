# emberjs-rails

This gem provides Ember.js 0.9.8 to the Rails assert pipeline. You can include it in a JS file:

```js
//= require emberjs
```

Or via a regular ol' `javascript_include_tag` call:

```ruby
javascript_include_tag( "emberjs" )
```

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile, preferably in the `:assets` gem group:

    gem "emberjs-rails", :git => "git://github.com/stvp/emberjs-rails.git"

Done. Go forth, grasshopper.
